# Be The Hero
Project developed during the OmniStack Week 11.0. This application permits NGOs to register yourself and share your incidents' informations like location, description, ways to be contacted and a value to help that incident to be resolved. Then people that would like to be a hero can see this list of incidents and help.

Remember to start the API before the web and or app application version, you can se more information about how to do this in each folder:
